# Octave range and notes

Notes in Trackerboy range from octaves 2 to 8. [Scientific pitch notation (SPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation)
is used, with C-2 being approximately 64 Hz. Valid notes range from C-2 to B-8,
inclusive, for channels 1-3. Valid notes on channel 4 range from C-2 to B-6,
inclusive. Attempting to use a note outside this range will result in the note
being clamped to its respective boundary.

## Channel frequency

Each channel has a frequency setting. Frequency in channels 1-3 is an 11-bit
number (0-2047) with 0 being the lowest and 2047 being the highest. Frequency
in channel 4 is a byte, with a specific format explained [here](../hardware/noise-channel.md).
Notes in Trackerboy are mapped to specific frequencies using a table lookup.
See below for the tables used.
