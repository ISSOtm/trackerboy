# Notes

Due to the complexity of MainWindow, the class implementation is broken into multiple source
files. The source files are located in this folder

Files:
 * actions.cpp - contains the createActions() function, handles setting up all QActions
                 used by the UI
 * slots.cpp - MainWindow's slot functions
